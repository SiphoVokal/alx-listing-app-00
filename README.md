# Project: ALX Listing App.

## About the Project
The ALX Listing App project aims to scaffold and lay the foundational structure for a modern Airbnb clone. This initial milestone focuses on setting up a well-organized and scalable codebase using Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ESLint. By establishing a clean folder structure, reusable components, and adhering to best practices, the project ensures a solid starting point for building a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly property listing page.

## Learning Objectives
This project is designed for professional developers to strengthen their expertise in modern web application development. By completing this milestone, learners will:

* Gain hands-on experience scaffolding a Next.js project tailored for production readiness.
* Implement TypeScript for type safety and reusable interfaces to enhance code maintainability and robustness.
* Configure TailwindCSS for building responsive, accessible, and visually appealing UI components.
* Structure a Next.js project following industry-standard best practices, ensuring scalability and readability.
* Create foundational reusable components and organize assets effectively for real-world applications.
